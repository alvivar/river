The core use case, intent, or business purpose for your use of the Twitter APIs.

    I wanna build an application that Tweets the images that I add into a folder
    on my computer.

    It's a desktop application configured to watch a custom folder, and when a
    new image is added to the folder, it will Tweet the image.

If you intend to analyze Tweets, Twitter users, or their content, share details
about the analyses you plan to conduct, and the methods or techniques.

    I won't analyze Tweets, users, or content.

If your use involves Tweeting, Retweeting, or liking content, share how you’ll
interact with Twitter accounts, or their content.

    The user will have a desktop application configured to watch a custom
    folder, and when a new image is added to the folder, it will Tweet the
    image.

If you’ll display Twitter content off of Twitter, explain how, and where, Tweets
and Twitter content will be displayed with your product or service, including
whether Tweets and Twitter content will be displayed at row level, or
aggregated.

    I won't be displaying content.
